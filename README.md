# JS_FrontEnd_Slider

==> https://frontendslider-afantes.netlify.app/

Explanation of the project :
----------------------------
This project creates a functional and interactive image slider. 

This image slider should enable users to navigate through different images (in this case, front-end web development topics) with a smooth transition effect. By clicking on an image, users are redirected to a web resource associated with that image. The slider also includes indicators for each image, and 'previous' and 'next' buttons to navigate through the slides.

Utility of the code :
---------------------
- User Engagement: The image slider provides a visually engaging way to present information or images to the users. The smooth transitions between slides thanks to CSS and the interactive elements added by JavaScript make for a dynamic user experience.

- Navigation: The slider includes 'previous' and 'next' buttons for users to manually navigate through the images. It also has clickable indicators that allow users to jump directly to a specific image.

- Information Display: Each slide in the carousel can represent different topics or categories. In this case, they represent different front-end web development languages. This allows to present a variety of information in a compact and organized way.

- Link to Resources: Each image in the slider is linked to a specific web resource. This can be an effective way to guide users towards more detailed information about each slide's topic.

- Adaptability: This slider can be adapted to a variety of uses. It can be used to display a portfolio, a product catalog, a series of blog posts, or any other collection of images or information. With some tweaks to the code, the slider can fit a wide range of needs.
